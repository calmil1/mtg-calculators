hello everyone,

thought i'd try and make some helpful calculators for mtg in order to help others.
if you have any ideas for calculators that need making please go comment on my youtube @imsnoot

thank you all! there's no license so go use whatever for whatever.
at the moment they're all .py files, but maybe at somepoint I will compile them into a website.

this is a test
